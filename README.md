Open the project in android studio and run it on emulator/physical device. App is really simple to use, just enter username and press the button to list repositories, then select a repository to see insights about languages used.<br/><br/>
I solved the problem using GitHubs REST API and to communicate with endpoints I used Googles Volley library. <br/>
Something I would add or might try to add in the future is an option to authenticate yourself to see yours private repositories. Another thing would be some kind of filtering system to filter repositories according to most used language. Also adding a chart would make the app a bit prettier :).<br/><br/>

<b>EDIT:</b> I've decided to add charts, since I'm using external library I will be keeping this version on seperate branch called "charts". Below are some images of final product :) .<br/><br/>
